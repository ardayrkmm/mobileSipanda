## ✨ Key Features

* **📍 Nearest Locations**: Displays habitat locations or conservation centers for protected wildlife across Indonesia based on the user’s current position.
* **🚨 Reporting Feature**: Allows users to report incidents related to protected animals (such as illegal trade or injured animals) directly through the application.
* **🔍 AI Scan (CNN)**: An animal identification feature using the device camera. If users do not know the type of animal they encounter, AI powered by a *Convolutional Neural Network* (CNN) will automatically detect it.
* **📖 Wildlife Education**: Comprehensive information about conservation status and ways to protect Indonesia’s endemic wildlife.
